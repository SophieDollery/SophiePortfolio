Valentines Mod - A Minecraft Forge mod that brings love, chaos, and sillies to your world.

This is a silly little mod I made for Valentines Day last year (2025) that I haven't had the courage to fully finish, but hopefully by this coming February (2026) I'll have completed it.
This mod contains:
- New ingots, armor sets, and incomplete toolsets.
- A new crop called "passionfruit" to soothe your sweet tooth.
- A "flustered" effect that makes hearts appear around you.
- A wedding ring that makes you flustered if within proximity to another player with a wedding ring in their inventory.
- Cute little Jitterbugs that jump around and spread the message of love! (please don't eat them.)
