Projects

Valentines Mod (Minecraft)
A Forge mod I built with cute Jitterbugs, relationship-themed armor sets, and whimsical gameplay mechanics. Features:
- Jitterbugs that give players the Flustered effect
- Armor sets: Goldheart, Heartache, Oathbound, Voidheart
- Wedding ring item that interacts with armor effects when active
- Sweet themed crops
- Fully playable in Minecraft 1.20 with Forge

Upcoming Projects
- Once Upon a Random (Godot): Procedurally generated story game featuring a tiny wizard. 
- [Other projects will be added here as I finish them]
